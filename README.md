# theater-safety

Sometimes, the safest thing people can do is flee from danger. But what if they’re in a room with dozens, or hundreds, of other people when that danger arises? How do they get out? And did the people who designed the room they are in, whether it’s an intimate theater or a concert hall or a sprawling convention center, think about how to get people out the doors — fast — in an emergency? 

In the acossiated paper we outline a methodology for evaluating a room on the basis of safety, taking the time for the room to evacuate in the case of a sudden terrifying event as our metric of safety. We also develop a way to optimize the design of a room for safety, and propose a regulatory framework for ensuring new construction is safe.

This is the codebase that enables that framework.
